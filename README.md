# 2015

Welcome all!!!

Come join us in our pursuit to detect cosmic rays!

Our goal is to create an easy to use and accesible place for all quarknet participants to access previous years code.

All our code in python and verilog will be posted into the 2015 repository

This year's google docs can be found at the following link: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2Xi0uM3sbvufngxcmZGUVZqdGU1VUlmU0wtLUVKZUlQSER1UVR1VmJITFhQLTR1MEpfSlE

Other documents can be found in the documents folder of the program's computer under the directory "Quarknet 2015"
